# Word-like GUI Application

This is a text editor that hopefully will be close in functionality to Microsoft Word. It currently has buttons for bold, italic and underline, changing the font size (proof of concept), it also has a toolbar at the top of thd window for opening and saving files, and preferences (proof of concept), an edit menu that has same functionality of bold, italic and underline buttons, undo and redo buttons (proof of concept), and cut, copy and paste buttons (proof of concept). It also has a View menu that curretnly only has the option for dark mode.
Included within the repository is a copy of this readme file, a license file, a python file and, in future, an exectuable file.
